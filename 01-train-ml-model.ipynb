    "We want the model to predict the duration of a trip. This can be useful for the taxi drivers to plan their trips, for the customers to know how long a trip will take but also for the taxi companies to plan their fleet. The first two predictions would need real time predictions because the duration of a trip is not known in advance. The last one could be done in batch mode, as it is more a analytical task that doesn't need to be done in real time.\n",
